# Heart Disease Prediction 

This project consists of two main components:
- **Backend (Flask API)**: It receives user input, processes it, and returns heart disease risk predictions using machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost, Keras).
- **Frontend (Vue.js)**: A user interface that allows users to input their health data and displays the risk predictions and charts.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x** (for the backend)
- **Node.js and npm** (for the frontend)
- **Vue CLI** (for frontend development)
- **Required Python libraries** (for backend)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up the Backend (Flask API)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IvyAnalisa/XAI_heart_disease.git
   

2. Set up a virtual environment for Python (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **requirements.txt** should include the following libraries:
   - Flask
   - Flask-CORS
   - scikit-learn
   - xgboost
   - keras
   - joblib
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib

4. Place the trained models (`svm_model.pkl`, `xgb_model.pkl`, `keras_model.h5`, `scaler.pkl`) in the `models/` folder.
   
6. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
run python train_model.py
   The Flask API will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Step 2: Set Up the Frontend (Vue.js)

1. Navigate to the `frontend/` folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   npm install chart.js (for displaying chart on frontend)

3. Run the Vue.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Step 3: Using the Application

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
2. Enter the required health data in the "Enter Measurements" section.
3. Submit the form, and the backend will predict the risk percentages for heart disease using the models (SVM, XGBoost, Keras).
4. The frontend will display:
   - Pie charts showing predictions for each model.
   - A text summary of the predicted risk percentages from each model.

### Step 4: Testing the API (Optional)

To test the backend independently, you can use any API testing tool like Postman, or use `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "Gender": "Male",
  "AgeCategory": "40-44",
  "Weight": 70,
  "Height": 175,
  "Smoking": "Sometimes",
  "Alcohol": 2,
  "Sleep": 8,
  "Exercise": 150,
  "Fruit": 2,
  "Diabetes": false,
  "Kidney": false,
  "Stroke": false
}'
```

This will return the risk predictions and the corresponding pie chart images.

Added original frontend folder as frontend_copy. To run locate to folder:
```bash
cd frontend_copy

npm install

// npm audit fix , if necessary

npm run dev
```
## Training Model Overview:
### Trained Models:
#### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- A powerful classification model that finds the optimal hyperplane for separating classes.
- Trained with probability estimation enabled for confidence scoring.
#### XGBoost Classifier
- A gradient boosting model optimized for structured data.
- Uses log loss as the evaluation metric to improve classification accuracy.
#### Keras Deep Learning Model
- A neural network with two hidden layers:
   64 neurons (ReLU activation)
   32 neurons (ReLU activation)
- Final output layer uses sigmoid activation for binary classification (Heart Disease: Yes/No).
### Training Pipeline:
#### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Scaling numeric features
#### Step 2: Train-Test Split
- Splitting dataset into 80% training / 20% testing
#### Step 3: Model Training
- Each model is trained on scaled data
#### Step 4: Model Saving
- Trained models are saved for future use (.pkl for SVM/XGBoost, .h5 for Keras)
#### Step 5: Feature Importance Analysis
- SHAP values and feature importance are computed for XGBoost to improve model interpretability
## Deployment:
#### Build and run the Docker container:
- docker build -t xai-heart-disease-app .
- docker run -p 5000:5000 xai-heart-disease-app
